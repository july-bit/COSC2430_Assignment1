            <p>Early 2022, my friends group partook in a trip to Da Lat. We stayed there for 5 days and 4 nights.
            Our team booked a small homestay located in the center of the city, creating ease of
            transportation. We went to a beautiful coffee residing on the rolling hills of Lam Dong province on our first day.
            The coffee provided us with an astonishing view of the gorgeous green nature, fresh air, and plenty of green trees.

            Besides, I went to visit my family members in Gia Lai during the semester break in Sem C. My little companion
            is my 7 years old little brother, whom I adore so much. Together, we went to the airport
            and flew back home on our own. My brother and I spent around a month there in Gia Lai, going to several tourist
            attraction places with my dad. We highly recommend a vermicelli restaurant on Pham Van Dong street, Pleiku City. The
            food there was heavenly.
